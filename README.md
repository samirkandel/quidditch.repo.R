## About the project. 

This is quidditch repo. It was my assignment for Analytics Programming Unit in University. 

### Assignment tasks:

Internationalquidditch Federation (IQF) has contracted you to assist in their analysis and reporting of
results. You have been provided the data file competitionResults.csv containing details of each match
(the teams that played, which team caught the snitch, and each team’s number of goals).

The IQF wants you to use the file to provide the needed four pieces of analysis below. The IQF also
want to use your code for analysis of future data files.

1. Write the code to compute the total scored by each team for each match. Note that each goal is
worth 10 points and the team that caught the snitch is awarded an extra 50 points. Run your code
on the data and present the results in a table showing the season and round number, the match
number (a new variable that identifies each match of the season), the home and away team names
and their scores

2. The winner of each match is the team who has the highest score. Each team scores 3 points for a
win and 1 point for a draw and the team with the most points at the end of the season is the season
winner. Write the code to compute each team’s points after the first 5 rounds of matches and the
full season. Provide the results for a season in a table (two tables, one table for each set of results),
ordering teams by their points (i.e. a results ladder). Pick the season who’s last digit corresponds to
your SID’s final digit.

3. An investigation into home game advantage is planned for the coming months. Write a function
that returns a count of the number of home games each team has had, the total number of games
each team has played in, the total points scored in a home game and the total number of points the
team has scored. Provide these results in a data frame. Run the function on the provided data and
show the resulting table output.

4. Provide a table containing the team statistics for all seasons. Including, but not limited to the following: number of games, number of wins, winning percentage, points scored, points conceded, number of snitch catches, goals scored, number of tournament wins. Order the teams in terms of total points scored.

#### Write a PDF report containing your code and all required analysis and results
